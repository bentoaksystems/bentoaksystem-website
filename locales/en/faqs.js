    q6: 'How is the development team organised?',
    a6: 'We use agile methodologies, especially scrum, for developing software. We try to plan for two to four weeks ahead, and we will have daily stand-ups to catch up with each other in the dev team. For other stakeholders, we will have weekly or biweekly demo sessions and progress reports.',

    q4: 'How does the trial period work?',
    a4: 'We are confident that we introduce a great team mate to you. So, in the beginning of a contract, you have four weeks to declare that you are not happy with the hire.

    q5: 'Can we offer a team mate, whom we hired through the Work Frame, to have a direct contract with us?',
